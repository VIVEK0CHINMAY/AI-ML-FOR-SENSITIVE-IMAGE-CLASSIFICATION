# Sensitive Image Classification

## Overview
This project focuses on classifying images as either sensitive or non-sensitive using deep learning models. The project utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and MobileNet to achieve accurate image classification. A Tkinter GUI is implemented to make the model accessible and user-friendly. The dataset for training and testing was downloaded from Kaggle.

## Project Structure
The project is organized into the following directories and files:

- **data/**: Contains the dataset downloaded from Kaggle, including training, validation, and test images.
- **models/**: Stores the saved models after training (CNN and MobileNet).
- **scripts/**: Contains the Python scripts used for data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and the GUI.
- **code.py**: Main file that runs the Tkinter-based GUI for image classification.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was sourced from Kaggle. It includes a variety of sensitive and non-sensitive images, divided into training, validation, and testing sets.

- **Sensitive Images**: Images deemed inappropriate or unsuitable for general audiences.
- **Non-Sensitive Images**: General images that are safe for viewing by all audiences.
